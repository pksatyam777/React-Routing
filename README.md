In this example we have 3 “pages” handled by the router: a home page, an about page, 
and a users page. As you click around on the different <Link>s,
the router renders the matching <Route>.Note: Behind the scenes a 
<Link> renders an <a> with a real href, so people using the keyboard
for navigation or screen readers will still be able to use this app.
